# 🗄️ SQL_NoSQL_Explorer

A deep dive into **SQL** and **NoSQL** databases — covering schema design, CRUD operations, queries, optimization, and integration with Node.js APIs.  
This repository demonstrates practical database knowledge for both relational and non-relational systems.

---

## 🎯 Goal
To master database design, query optimization, and efficient data handling using SQL (PostgreSQL/MySQL) and NoSQL (MongoDB).  
Includes real-world examples, relationships, and API-based integrations.

## 📚 Topics Covered

### 🧩 SQL (Relational Databases)
- Database design and normalization  
- Primary, foreign, and composite keys  
- Joins (INNER, LEFT, RIGHT, FULL)  
- Aggregate functions (SUM, COUNT, AVG)  
- Subqueries and CTEs  
- Views, Triggers, and Stored Procedures  
- Indexing and Query Optimization  
- Transactions and ACID properties  

### 🌿 NoSQL (MongoDB / Document Databases)
- Collections and Documents  
- CRUD Operations (`find()`, `insertOne()`, `updateOne()`, `deleteOne()`)  
- Schema design using Mongoose  
- Relationships (Embedding vs Referencing)  
- Aggregation Pipelines  
- Indexing and Performance  
- MongoDB Atlas and Cloud Deployment
